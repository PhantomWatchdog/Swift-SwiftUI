# Swift / SwiftUI

Here is the start of my learning path with Swift / SwiftUI.
That's with a particular attraction by the Apple environment and tools i choosed to engage myself in this way :nerd_face:

## Why Swift

You see, Swift is a relatively young language, launched in 2014.

Being such a new programming language means that Swift leverages all sorts of new ideas built upon the successes – and sometimes mistakes – of older languages.

Swift itself is just the language, and isn’t designed to draw anything on the screen. When it comes to building software with Swift, we’ll be using SwiftUI: Apple’s powerful framework that creates text, buttons, images, user interaction, and much more :star_struck:

As the name suggests, SwiftUI was built for Swift – it’s literally designed to leverage the power and safety offered by the language, which makes it remarkably quick to build really powerful apps.

So, this repository will demonstrate my progress troughthout my personal curriculum :mechanical_arm:
