# Day-2

Today weâ€™re continuing that as we explore storing truth with Booleans, and building up strings with interpolation.

## Key Concepts

- Store Booleans
- Join Strings

## Summary

- Swift let us create constants using ***let*** and variables with ***var***
- Swift strings contain text, from short strings to whole novels
- I create strings with use of double quotes at start and end
- Numbers are calls integers or ***Int***
